        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>
            McFerrin was born in Manhattan, New York City, the son of 
            operatic baritone Robert McFerrin and singer Sara Copper.
            He attended Cathedral High School in Los Angeles , Cerritos
            College, University of Illinois at Springfield (then known
            as Sangamon State University) and the California State 
            University, Sacramento.

        <h2>Vocal Technique</h2>
        <p>
            As a vocalist, McFerrin often switches rapidly between modal
            and falsetto registers to create polyphonic effects, performing
            both the main melody and the accompanying parts of songs. He 
            makes use of percussive effects created both with his mouth and
            by tapping on his chest. McFerrin is also capable of multiphonic
            singing.
